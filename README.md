# Web-Scraping-With-Python
# Welcome to the Web Scraping Repository

This repository highlights my process for scraping data from the internrt using Python. It's designed to showcase the difference between **static** and **dynamic** web scraping, using tools like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium`.

# 📁 Repository Structure

- `README.md`
- `static_web_scraping.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating how to scrape data from websites with static content (where all the data is already loaded in the HTML).
- `dynamic_web_scraping.ipynb`: A notebook focused on scraping data from dynamic websites (where content is rendered using JavaScript).


## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup`
- `selenium`
- `pandas`


 ## 📝 Notes
The static scraping example uses books.toscrape.com (a practice website) and also wikipedia GDP forecast by country

The dynamic scraping example uses a demo site with JavaScript-loaded content.
